This is a repository for a Full Stack Airbnb Clone with Next.js 13 App Router: React, Tailwind, Prisma, MongoDB, NextAuth.



Features:

- Tailwind design

- Advanced search algorithm by category, date range, map location, number of guests, rooms and bathrooms
    - For example we will filter out properties that have a reservation in your desired date range to travel

    - Lets say you select a category, location and date range, you will be able to share URL with a logged out friend in another browser and they will see the same results
- How to write POST and DELETE routes in route handlers (app/api)
- How to fetch data in server react components by directly accessing database (WITHOUT API! like Magic!)
- How to handle files like error.tsx and loading.tsx which are new Next 13 templating files to unify loading and error handling
- How to handle relations between Server and Child components!
